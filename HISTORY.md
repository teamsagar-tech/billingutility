## [2026-10-13] Architectural Audit, CTO Brain Setup & Customer Billing Messaging Initialization

### 1. Context & Motivation
The user requested an architectural audit of what has been developed so far in `digital-invoice-system` and how it relates to `RetailNodeV2`. Additionally, the mission was defined to develop the enterprise customer billing messaging SaaS platform targeting production domain `bill.retailnode.in` on server IP `95.135.166.109`, adopting the identical CTO standards, brain rules, skills, and chat history tracking used in RetailNode.

### 2. Audit of Existing Codebase
- **`backend-api`**:
  - Express.js backend on port 4000.
  - MySQL database with tables for `tenants`, `users`, `customers`, `invoices`, `loyalty_settings`, `referral_settings`, `referrals`.
  - Redis cache under `invoice:{shortId}` (24-hour TTL).
  - Ingestion endpoint `POST /api/v1/invoices/upload` with store API token authentication (`x-api-token`).
  - Public invoice retrieval endpoint `GET /api/v1/invoices/:slug` returning receipt payload, customer loyalty balance, visit history, and store branding.
  - Early-stage WhatsApp dispatch using Meta Graph API with hardcoded `localhost:3000` URLs.
- **`web-receipt`**:
  - Next.js 15+ application on port 3000.
  - Interactive digital receipt at `/t/[slug]` featuring line items, taxes, loyalty badges, referral coupons, star feedback rating, Google review routing, and PDF/WhatsApp sharing.
  - Merchant dashboard at `/dashboard` for analytics, customers, loyalty, referrals, and WABA credentials.
- **`print-agent`**:
  - C# WPF Windows print spooler interceptor for retail POS environments (Tally, Busy, Marg) parsing customer phone, invoice number, and line items from ESC/POS print streams.
- **Marketing App (`billintegration` root)**:
  - React + Vite web application showcasing Digital Bills, CRM, Marketing Automation, Loyalty Programs, and retail industry solutions.
- **RetailNodeV2 ERP Comparison**:
  - RetailNodeV2 possesses 24 strict CTO rules, multi-tenancy (`firm_id`/`tenant_id`), ACID transactions, pessimistic locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), and production WABA gateway integrations via `https://waba.mpocket.in` with utility message templates.

### 3. Brain, Rules, and Skills Setup (`.agents/`)
Successfully established the full enterprise brain framework inside the project root:
- `.agents/AGENTS.md`: Full CTO Lead Enterprise SaaS Architect instructions with all 24 strict rules adapted for billing SaaS.
- `.agents/SCHEMA_DICTIONARY.md`: Complete database dictionary including `tenants`, `users`, `customers`, `invoices`, `billing_messages`, `loyalty_settings`, `referrals`, `feedback_responses`, and `action_logs`.
- `.agents/rules/git-sync.md`: Continuous syncing of brain artifacts, plans, and skills.
- `.agents/rules/cto-standards.md`: Plan-First halt protocol, ACID transactions, and keyboard UX standards.
- `.agents/skills/deployment/SKILL.md`: Production deployment SOP targeting `95.135.166.109` and `bill.retailnode.in`.
- `.agents/skills/billing-messaging/SKILL.md`: End-to-end SOP for billing message delivery over WABA (`waba.mpocket.in`), Meta Cloud API, and SMS fallback.
- `.agents/skills/page-creation/SKILL.md` & `.agents/skills/form-accessibility/SKILL.md`: Frontend standards for rapid keyboard navigation and accessibility.
- `.agents/scripts/save_transcript.py` & `.agents/hooks.json`: Automated transcript and plan synchronization.
- `.agents/conversations/`: Transcripts preserved for active (`2ccf087c-9b59-49d3-b5c8-f4393c93c30f`) and historical (`8cfc030c-b5c9-47b2-8b65-41b5cafc7d82`) conversations.
- `.agents/plans/`: Created `architecture_plan.md`, `task.md`, and `walkthrough.md`.

### 4. Next Milestone: Phase 2 Implementation
- Database migration adding `billing_messages` table and tenant gateway configurations.
- Dual WABA gateway service (`waba_custom` via `waba.mpocket.in` + Meta Graph API).
- Production URL resolution to `https://bill.retailnode.in/t/{shortId}`.
- MySQL transactions for invoice ingestion and customer loyalty updates.
- WhatsApp delivery status callback webhook.
